There are three approaches

1- Refrences ( Normalization ) 
        -> having consistency ( modification in author obj do modify its occurance in course object )
        -> separate query for both object
        -> query not fast

    author{
        id: 
        name :
    }
    course{
        author : author_id (refrence to author object..)
    }


2- Embedded Document ( Denormalization..)
        -> having inconsistency
        -> fastest query (gives us Performance..)
        -> single query for both object
    
    course{
        author{

        }
    }

3 - Hybrid 
        -> having a snapshot of data at a point of time..
        -> like use in Ecommerce website..

    author{
        id:
        name:
        // other prop
    }

    course{
        author{
            id : refs to author obj
            name : 
        }
    }

they are long string that identifies user
like driving liences or password..

when user login to srver it generate json web tokens and retruns to client 
and tell client that next time you login our system you have to sho this token..

at client we need to store it so we can send  to server on future API calls
store it in local storage of browser in web application

3 parts of jsonWebTokens 
1 - headers
2 -  include clients public properties like name id etc..
so we dont need to send extra query to database to get these properties

3 - digital signatures that store json object along with private key that is store in server..
so if a client modifies web token digital signature chnge and become invalid..
to make new digital signature we need private key that onl store in server
